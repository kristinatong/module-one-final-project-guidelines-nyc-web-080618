## About
* This CLI app is a survey intended for students as the primary user, to complete on a weekly basis. Students review their Teachers by writing descriptions and providing their ratings based on the teachers easiness, quality, helpfulness and using interactive emojicons to as feedback of their progress. The purpose for this app is to give Students the opportunity to express how they feel and also to give Teachers genuine feedback about their students feelings.
